# MiningGame
Mining-game is a Minecraft-inspired 2D game where you play as a miner that can mine and place blocks, as well as create machines using blocks such as pistons and levers. The project was created a few weeks into my first python course, which is why the project contains alot of spaghetti code (but if it runs, it runs, right?), however it was also my first big project, and gave me alot of confidence to continue on my programming journey. Here is a clip of me experimenting with different features in the game: https://clipchamp.com/watch/tDCsIPDttq8/embed
